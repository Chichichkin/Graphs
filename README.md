# Graphs
My C++ realization of graps as discrete mathematics task. 

  A class in C ++ that describes a graph / digraph. The class support the following functionality:
• determination of the number of vertices;
• determination of the number of edges (arcs);
• determination of the degree of an arbitrary vertex (for a digraph - half-degrees of outcome and approach);
• determination of the power sequence of the graph;
• definition of an adjacency matrix;
• definition of the incidence matrix;
• definition of adjacency list;
• determination of hanging vertices, determination of isolated vertices;
• definition in a digraph of sources and sinks;
• determination of the distance between two peaks;
• determination of the eccentricity of the peak;
• determination of the diameter of the graph;
• determination of the radius of the graph;
• determination of the center of the graph;
• definition of peripheral peaks;
• adding / removing vertices to the graph;
• adding / removing edges to the graph;
• definition of addition to the graph;
• subdivision of the rib;
• contraction of the graph;
• identification of vertices;
• duplication of the top;
• breeding peaks;
• union (disjunctive) graphs;
• connection of graphs;
• product of graphs;
• input / output of graphs into a text file as an adjacency list in the following format: {1 <adjacent vertices through a space> ...} {2 <adjacent vertices through a space} ... For example: {1 2} {2 1 4} {3} { 4 2}.

  The main program demonstrate the capabilities of the developed class.
• it allow the user to specify a graph in any of three types (adjacency list, adjacency matrix or incidence matrix) and receive any other representation at the output;
• at the user's request, display the characteristics of the graph (number of vertices, number of edges, power sequence, degree of the selected vertex);
• allow the user to perform operations implemented in the class;
